		<p>the car pulled beside me and I stopped walking
i was her breath, arms that hold your sleepy face.
Itâ€™s already 3 months since I set my pulse in motion, syncing is the universe's blessing.
My eyes are the future manifestos, she said, i am grey skies and indecisions.
Bathed in questions and insecureties, similarities. 
I offered what i have, she's not used to it. Must be too much i think.
Pull back. Do you love me ?
she drove away.</p>
